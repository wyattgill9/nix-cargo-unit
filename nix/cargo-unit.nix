  /**
  Build a Rust workspace as one Nix derivation per Cargo rustc unit.

  Each generated unit gets a scoped source input by default. Workspace crates
  receive their own package root, and registry/git crates receive their own
  vendored package directory. A source edit in `crates/api` does not change
  the Nix input for `crates/worker`, `itoa`, or `ryu`; a `Cargo.lock` update
  for one transitive crate leaves unrelated vendored crate derivations alone.
  Git dependency `outputHashes` are keyed by the exact `Cargo.lock` source
  string, including the locked rev, so multi-package git repos share one
  tree hash without losing package identity.
  The planning stage is manifest-scoped the same way: the whole-workspace
  `cargo --unit-graph` IFD runs in a content-stubbed tree (manifests
  verbatim, every other source file an empty stub at its exact path), so a
  source body edit re-runs only the cheap render IFD (whose include-scan
  reads real contents), never the workspace-wide cargo resolve; adding or
  removing files, or editing a manifest, re-plans (#3900).
  Pass `workspaceRoot = ./.` for local workspaces so `src` can stay a filtered
  build input while package scopes are carved from the real checkout root.
  Rendering fails when a unit path cannot be tied back to `src` or `vendorDir`.
  Pass `cargoTargets = [ [ "--workspace" ] [ "--workspace" "--tests" ] ]`
  to expose roots from several Cargo executions through one generated graph.
  Roots are consumed lazily: `binaries.<name>`, `libraries.<name>`, and
  `targetSets.<set>.*` each reference one rustc unit derivation, so selecting
  a subset of roots (say the native cdylibs out of a graph that also plans a
  wasm target) never builds the other entries' units. A second buildWorkspace
  call that only narrows `cargoTargets` yields byte-identical root
  derivations (pinned by a tests/default.nix assertion) and adds a unit-graph
  plus render IFD; create a separate workspace only when unit identity
  changes (profile, policy, rustToolchain, env, extraRustcArgs). `env` and
  `extraRustcArgs` fold into every unit, so values or native-library flags for
  one crate bust or perturb the whole dependency closure; scope them with
  `packageBuildEnv.<package> = { ... }` or
  `packageRustcArgs.<package> = [ ... ]` instead.
  Every unit compiles with `--remap-path-prefix` over its own source and over
  the toolchain's `rust-src`, unconditionally: `file!()` expands to an absolute
  path, which here is a store path, so without it every `unwrap` location in a
  dependency pins that dependency's source into the runtime closure of the
  linked binary and a 23 MB executable retains 2.5 GiB. Panic messages and
  backtraces name `/build/<crate>-<version>` and `/rustc` in place of the store
  path; `include_str!` and `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` read the real
  filesystem and are unaffected, so a crate that deliberately embeds a store
  path keeps it. Top-level
  `binaries`/`libraries` dedupe by Cargo target name and the first
  `cargoTargets` entry wins, so when one crate roots under several entries,
  select through `targetSets.<set>` instead. Per-case discovery is the
  exception to per-root laziness: `tests.<target>.cases` uses a shared
  manifest IFD that builds every test binary in the graph, and
  `doctests.<target>.cases` uses a shared doctest manifest covering every
  doctest target.
  Include `--benches` or `--bench <name>` to expose `[[bench]]` roots under
  `benchmarks` and `benchmarkPlan`. Tango benches can compare previous and
  next artifacts with `next.compareTangoBenchmarks { baseline = previous; }`,
  where `previous` is another generated workspace or a `benchmarkPlan` path.
  Test graphs also expose `coverageReport` and `makeCoverageReport`; build the
  workspace with `extraRustcArgs = [ "-Cinstrument-coverage" ]` and consume the
  generated `$out/lcov.info`. The selected Rust toolchain must provide matching
  `llvm-cov` and `llvm-profdata`, or callers must pass explicit tool paths to
  `makeCoverageReport`.

  `cargoConfigRustflags = true` applies the rustflags a normal `cargo build`
  would read from `<workspaceRoot>/.cargo/config.toml` (cargoUnit otherwise
  ignores cargo's config). Flags are resolved per target triple with cargo
  precedence (`target.<triple>.rustflags` over `build.rustflags`); `cfg(...)`
  target sections and the `[env]` table are not honored. Default off.

  Returns the generated attrset with `sourceAudit`, `units`, `roots`, `checkedRoots`,
  `packages`, `binaries`, `libraries`, `benchmarks`, `coverageReport`, `default`,
  `policyChecks`, plus the intermediate `plannerSource`, `unitGraphJson`,
  `unitsNix`, and `vendorDir` derivations for inspection (`unitGraphJson`'s
  paths carry the planner stub's store prefix, not `src`'s).

  `testPolicyByPackage.<package>` accepts structured test-runner policy:
  `{ skip = [ "case_name" ]; testThreads = "1"; }`. `buildWorkspace` renders
  it to libtest args for cargo-unit's per-test runner and to cargo-nextest
  filters for `testChecksByTarget`. Callers should pass policy data, not
  runner-specific argv.

  `rust.resolveArgs` resolves the shared bundle (context, policy, linker,
  effects, checks) once; the two IFD stages and the unit import below read the
  once-resolved values (configScript, toolchainId, cargoLockPath, render flags,
  mold/clippy args, workspace checks) straight off it. The remaining knobs
  (`profile`, `target`, `contentAddressed`, `cargoTargets`,
  `extraUnits`/`extraLibraries`, the `test*` forwarding) each have a single
  reader and are read from raw args at that use site.

  /**
  Build a library unit derivation from already-compiled artifacts instead of
  from source.

  The result is byte-contract-identical to a library unit the renderer would
  emit (`packages/nix-cargo-unit/src/render.rs:1375-1402`): `$out` carries
  `$out/lib/lib<name>-<hash>.rlib`, the matching `.rmeta`, and
  `$out/nix-support/extern-path` holding the absolute path to the `.rlib`.
  A downstream unit therefore consumes it exactly like a from-source unit:
  `-L dependency=$out/lib` and `--extern <crate>=$(cat $out/nix-support/extern-path)`
  (`render.rs:1015-1047`).

  Pass the produced derivation through `buildWorkspace`'s `extraUnits` (keyed by
  `"<name>-<version>-<hash>"`). Because a unit's `<hash>` hashes package
  identity, target, edition, crate-types, features, profile, dependency
  identities, and the toolchain id, but never the source bytes
  (`model.rs:612-672`, `hash.rs:18-26`), a metadata-faithful stub crate yields
  the same `<hash>` as the real prebuilt, so injecting this unit links a
  downstream crate against a prebuilt rlib with no source present.

  Scope: this is for plain `rlib` libraries only. The artifact name and
  `extern-path` hardcode `.rlib`, so a `cdylib`, `staticlib`, or `proc-macro`
  crate (different artifact extension, and proc-macros load as host dylibs) is
  out of scope and would not link.

  Trust boundary: an injected prebuilt unit BYPASSES every per-unit policy gate
  (clippy, `--deny-panics`, unused-crate-dependencies) because those gates run
  on from-source compile units, not on a copied artifact. Inject only trusted
  artifacts (e.g. a first-party SDK rlib fetched from your own R2).

  `extraLibraries` is usually unnecessary: `buildWorkspace`'s `libraries` set
  derives from `units`, and a downstream crate links via `units.<key>`, so
  overriding `extraUnits.<key>` already routes the link through the prebuilt.
  Reach for `extraLibraries` only to make `workspace.libraries.<name>` itself
  point at the prebuilt (e.g. for `selectLibraryWithTests`).

  Arguments:
  - `pname`: the library unit's Cargo target name (the leading component of the
    unit key), which for a default `lib` target is the underscored crate name
    (e.g. package `my-lib` has target `my_lib`). Any dashes are mapped to
    underscores for the on-disk artifact names, matching the renderer.
  - `version`: the crate version, used only to build the unit key the caller
    injects under.
  - `hash`: the source-independent unit hash. Must equal the `<hash>` the
    renderer computes for the metadata-faithful stub the downstream graph sees,
    or the downstream `--extern`/`-L` references will not resolve to this unit.
  - `rlib`: path to the compiled `.rlib` artifact.
  - `rmeta`: path to the compiled `.rmeta` artifact.
  - `toolchainId`: the toolchain id the prebuilt was compiled with. Asserted
    equal to `baseNameOf (toString rustToolchain)` so a toolchain mismatch
    fails at eval, never at link time. Also recorded in `passthru.toolchainId`
    so `buildWorkspace` can cross-check it against the workspace's actual
    toolchain at injection time.
  - `rustToolchain`: optional; defaults to `rust.defaultRustToolchain`. Used
    only for the toolchain-id assertion. A caller whose `buildWorkspace` uses a
    non-default toolchain MUST thread that same `rustToolchain` here, or the
    workspace-side cross-check in `buildWorkspace` will reject the injection.
  - `depUnits`: this prebuilt's own dependency unit derivations, each built
    with `mkPrebuiltLibraryUnit` (each entry must carry `passthru.unitKey`).
    Direct deps that each record their own `depUnits`, or a flattened
    transitive list, inject identically. Defaults to `[ ]` (a leaf library).
    `buildWorkspace` walks `passthru.depUnits` transitively and auto-injects
    every recorded unit into the consuming graph under its own
    `passthru.unitKey`, so the caller injects only the root unit. Each
    auto-injected key must name a unit the consumer's graph already
    references (the C1 guard), which holds exactly when the consumer's
    manifest pins the dependency closure the prebuilt was compiled against:
    the unit hash folds in dependency hashes recursively, so a root key match
    implies every dep key matches. An explicit `extraUnits` entry for a dep
    key overrides the recorded derivation. The deps are also recorded to
    `$out/nix-support/dependency-units` for provenance.
